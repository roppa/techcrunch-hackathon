#Techcrunch Hackathon

This was an app I built in < 24 hours. The idea was to take Sky TV show metadata, run it through IBM Watson Natural Language Classifier to get the emotional tone of the show. A user would send a sms message with their current emotional state i.e. "meh", "awesome", 50, 100, ";'(" et al. and the app would suggest a show based on that emotion.
